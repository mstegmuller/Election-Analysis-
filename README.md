Election Audit Summary
A proposal would be for future elections would be to replace the names for different candidates in future years. Both names and candidates for different counties and candidates can be changed as well.  The script can be modified by demographic to help get an understanding of who is voting.  You can also put a script for who is voting for which candidate by county.  That way you can see which candidate is the most popular in each specific county.
